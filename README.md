# BankingApp
Basic banking app that shows compounded interest.
I did well ensuring that there are multiple options in order to see the compounded interest because I show the values monthly and yearly.
I could enhance my code significantly with the tabbing because when you have extremely large numbers(more than 10 decimals) the options won't be properly spaced.
Writing this I didn't have that many problems as this project was easier than the one from before it.
This project is decently maintainable as it is easy to update and if I want to add a simple banking system to a game with interest it will be easy to set on up now.
